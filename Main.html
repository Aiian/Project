            <h3>Hi! My name is Wojtek.</h3>
            <p>I'm just starting my way to become a programmer, so my site may look a bit shoddy, but hey, all grand
            things have humble beginnings (at least most of them).<br>
            I'm 25 years old, I've studied finance in Warsaw and Real Estate in London, then worked for almost two
            years in a family business in Szczawno-Zdr√≥j, a small spa resort in the south of Poland. Although I've
            met with many challenges, I started to feel a steady intellectual decline and decided to move on to
            something more mentally stimulating.<br>
            I thought about studying physics and even did the high school exams again, but finally I decided to try
            my luck with programming, something that has been on my mind for quite a long time now.<br>
            I'd like to learn more about applications programming, I think I'd rather specialize in the technical
            side rather than design and graphics.<br>
            Check below if you want to learn something more about my recent projects.</p>
